Alfred Extensions by Roger Braunstein @partlyhuman
==================================================

See the [Project Page](http://partlyhuman.github.com/alfred-extensions/)

My name's Roger. I use [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (too). I put together some simple extensions to help me work. I thought I'd share them here. They require the [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/). Enjoy!

## Quick Quote & Speak Quote
Gets a stock quote... Quick! ... Quickly! Uses Yahoo Finance feeds and a few lines of Ruby. In "Quick Quote," the ticker pops up in Notification Center. (When available, this will be updated to output in large text instead of Notification Center.) In "Speak Quote," the stock price and its movements are read out using your default voice. Cool.

Aside: I also like to set up a custom search for http://www.google.com/finance?q={query}, but this is far less obtrusive.

Usage: `qq aapl`  `sq aapl`

## ChronoMate Controls
ChronoMate is an app for tracking your time in FreshBooks. It's a great combo for freelancers. I highly recommend both if you haven't given them a shot.
With this extension you can do very basic timer control. It uses whatever project is already active. I also recommend Pomodoro Controls in conjunction with this.

Note: since ChronoMate is not scriptable, it's required that you have the Dock icon for ChronoMate enabled. This turns on some menu bars that I can get to with System Events.

Usage: `cm start` `cm stop` `cm log`

## Todo
All the Reminders scripts out there required me to type too much â€” or didn't work. I just need to remember to do one damn thing. Default list, no due dates, just get it on there and out of the front of my mind where it's keeping me from actually working. (Also it doesn't open the Reminders app. That's nice too.)

Usage: `todo take out trash`

## New Safari Window
This quickie AppleScript opens a new window of Safari, no matter what Space you're in, without switching Spaces. Like clicking "New Window" on the Dock icon but less sucky. Bind it to a hotkey. That is all.

This stuff requires Alfred, a free OS X app, and the Powerpack, a not so free addon. Safari icon, Reminders icon, and the programs they reference are
